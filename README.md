Here’s a detailed explanation of how you utilized **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**, **LangChain**, and **embedding models** in your project workflow:

---

### **Project Workflow with RAG, LangChain, and Embedding Models:**

#### 1. **Set Up Environment:**
   - You used the `python-dotenv` library to load the environment variables, specifically the **Google Gemini API key**, which is essential for interacting with Google’s LLM.

   ```python
   from dotenv import load_dotenv
   load_dotenv()
   GEMINI_API_KEY = os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY")
   genai.configure(api_key=GEMINI_API_KEY)
   ```

#### 2. **Text Extraction from PDFs:**
   - Using **PyPDF2**, you extracted text from the uploaded PDF files. This step converts the content of the PDFs into raw text.
   
   ```python
   def get_pdf_text(pdf_docs):
       text = ""
       for pdf in pdf_docs:
           pdf_reader = PdfReader(pdf)
           for page in pdf_reader.pages:
               text += page.extract_text()
       return text
   ```

#### 3. **Text Chunking with LangChain:**
   - You used **LangChain**'s `CharacterTextSplitter` to break down the extracted raw text into manageable chunks. This ensures that the chunks are small enough for efficient processing while maintaining context.
   
   ```python
   def get_text_chunks(text):
       text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(
           separator="\n",
           chunk_size=1000,
           chunk_overlap=200,
           length_function=len
       )
       return text_splitter.split_text(text)
   ```

#### 4. **Text Embedding with Sentence-Transformer:**
   - You used the **Sentence-Transformer** model (`'all-MiniLM-L6-v2'`) to generate **embeddings** for each text chunk. This transforms the raw text into a vector representation, making it suitable for search and similarity-based queries.
   
   ```python
   def embed_text_chunks(text_chunks):
       model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
       embeddings = model.encode(text_chunks)
       return embeddings
   ```

#### 5. **FAISS Vector Store Creation:**
   - **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)** is used to store and retrieve vectors efficiently. You created a FAISS index from the embeddings, allowing you to search for the most relevant text chunks based on a user's query.
   
   ```python
   def create_vectorstore(embeddings, text_chunks):
       dimension = embeddings.shape[1]
       index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dimension)
       index.add(embeddings)
       return index, text_chunks
   ```

#### 6. **Querying the FAISS Index:**
   - When a user inputs a query, the query is encoded into a vector using the same **Sentence-Transformer** model. This vector is compared with the stored text embeddings in the FAISS index to retrieve the most relevant chunks.
   
   ```python
   def query_vectorstore(query, index, text_chunks, model):
       query_embedding = model.encode([query])
       distances, indices = index.search(query_embedding, k=5)
       return [text_chunks[idx] for idx in indices[0]]
   ```

#### 7. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):**
   - The retrieved text chunks form the **context** for generating a refined answer using the **Google Gemini API**. This is where the RAG methodology comes in, as it combines retrieval (finding the relevant text chunks) with generation (refining the response using the language model).
   - You formatted the context and user query into a prompt and sent it to **Google Gemini API** for content generation:
   
   ```python
   def call_gemini_api(context, question):
       prompt = f"""You are an intelligent assistant. Use the following context to answer the question:
       
       Context:
       {context}
       
       Question:
       {question}
       """
       response = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-1.5-flash").generate_content(prompt)
       return response.text if hasattr(response, 'text') else "No text response from the model."
   ```

#### 8. **Integrating with Streamlit:**
   - The app is built using **Streamlit**, which allows users to upload PDFs, input queries, and see the results directly on the web interface. The workflow is as follows:
     1. **User uploads PDFs.**
     2. **Text is extracted and split into chunks.**
     3. **Embeddings are generated and stored in a FAISS index.**
     4. **User inputs a query.**
     5. **The relevant text chunks are retrieved using FAISS.**
     6. **The response is generated using Google Gemini API with RAG context.**
   
   ```python
   def main():
       st.set_page_config(page_title="Chat with PDFs", page_icon=":books:")
       st.header("CHAT WITH PDF :books:")
       
       with st.sidebar:
           st.subheader("Upload Your Documents")
           pdf_docs = st.file_uploader("Upload your PDFs here:", accept_multiple_files=True)
           if st.button("Process"):
               # Process uploaded PDFs
               ...
               
       # Query input and result display
       query = st.text_input("Ask a question based on your uploaded documents:")
       if query and 'index' in st.session_state and 'chunk_store' in st.session_state:
           # Search for answers and display result
           ...
   ```

### **How RAG, LangChain, and Embedding Models Work Together:**
   - **LangChain** helps manage the text processing, splitting it into manageable chunks.
   - **Sentence-Transformer** generates embeddings from the text chunks.
   - **FAISS** provides a fast and efficient way to search through embeddings for relevant chunks based on the user query.
   - **RAG** integrates the retrieval of relevant content with the generative capabilities of **Google Gemini API** to provide a refined answer.

### **Final Workflow Summary:**
1. **PDF Upload** → Extract text using PyPDF2.
2. **Text Chunking** → Split text into smaller chunks using LangChain.
3. **Embedding** → Generate text embeddings using Sentence-Transformer.
4. **Store Embeddings** → Use FAISS to store and retrieve embeddings efficiently.
5. **Querying** → Encode the query and retrieve relevant chunks from the FAISS index.
6. **Refine Answer** → Use the retrieved context with the Gemini API (RAG) to generate a refined answer.
7. **Streamlit Interface** → Upload PDFs, input query, and display results interactively.

This workflow ensures that your system can handle large documents, filter relevant information based on user input, and generate contextually accurate answers using advanced AI techniques.
